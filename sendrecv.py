# CSC 216 (Spring 2018)
# Reliable Transport Protocols (Homework 3)
#
# Sender-receiver code for the RDP simulation program.  You should provide
# your implementation for the homework in this file.
#
# Your various Sender implementations should inherit from the BaseSender
# class which exposes the following important methods you should use in your
# implementations:
#
# - sender.send_to_network(seg): sends the given segment to network to be
#   delivered to the appropriate recipient.
# - sender.start_timer(interval): starts a timer that will fire once interval
#   steps have passed in the simulation.  When the timer expires, the sender's
#   on_interrupt() method is called (which should be overridden in subclasses
#   if timer functionality is desired)
#
# Your various Receiver implementations should also inherit from the
# BaseReceiver class which exposes thef ollowing important methouds you should
# use in your implementations:
#
# - sender.send_to_network(seg): sends the given segment to network to be
#   delivered to the appropriate recipient.
# - sender.send_to_app(msg): sends the given message to receiver's application
#   layer (such a message has successfully traveled from sender to receiver)
#
# Subclasses of both BaseSender and BaseReceiver must implement various methods.
# See the NaiveSender and NaiveReceiver implementations below for more details.
